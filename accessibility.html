<h2>Preparation of this accessibility statement</h2>
<p><b>This statement was prepared on 23rd September 2020. It was last reviewed on 12th December 2024.</b></p> 

<p><b>The website was last tested on December 2024. The

Services Group at the University of Edinburgh</b> using
both automated and manual methods. The site was tested on a PC,
primarily using Microsoft Edge alongside Mozilla Firefox and Google
Chrome.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>Recent
world-wide usage levels survey for different screen readers and
browsers shows that Chrome, Mozilla Firefox and Microsoft Edge are
increasing in popularity and Google Chrome is now the favoured
browser for screen readers:</p>
<p>

</p>
<p><a href="https://webaim.org/projects/screenreadersurvey9/">WebAIM:
Screen Reader User Survey</a></p>
<p>

</p>
<p>The
aforementioned three browsers have been used in certain questions for
reasons of breadth and variety.</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>We
ran automated testing using <a href="https://wave.webaim.org/">WAVE
WebAIM</a> and AXE and

<ul>
	<li>Spell
	check functionality;</li>
	<li>Scaling

	<li>Options
	to customise the interface (magnification, font, background colour,

	<li>Data
	validation;</li>
	<li>Warning
	of links opening in new tab or window;</li>
	<li>Information

	<li>Flashing,
	moving or scrolling text;</li>
	<li>Use
	with screen reading software (for example JAWS);</li>
	<li>Assistive
	software (TextHelp Read and Write, Windows Magnifier, ZoomText,
	Dragon Naturally Speaking, TalkBack and VoiceOver);</li>
	<li>Tooltips
	and text alternatives for any non-text content;</li>
	<li>Time
	limits;</li>
	<li>Compatibility
	with mobile accessibility functionality (Android and iOS).</li>
	<li>Any
